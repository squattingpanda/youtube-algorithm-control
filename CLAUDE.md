# YouTube Algorithm Control Extension

## Project Brief
Chrome extension that lets users steer YouTube's algorithm with natural language preferences. Uses an LLM to score videos on the homepage against user-described preferences, hiding/dimming non-matching content. See the full brief in the original project conversation or ask Andrew.

**Repo:** https://github.com/squattingpanda/youtube-algorithm-control
**Git identity (local):** squattingpanda / andy@andrewbrowne.me

## Extension Architecture (Manifest V3)
```
youtube extension/
  manifest.json          # MV3, content script on youtube.com
  content.js             # DOM scraping + video detection
  # Future:
  popup.html / popup.js  # User preferences UI
  background.js          # LLM API calls
  core/                  # Shared filtering logic (reusable for mobile app later)
```

## Implementation Phases
1. ✅ **Phase 1: DOM Access** — Detect video thumbnails, extract titles/channels/duration, log to console
2. ✅ **Phase 2: Basic UI** — Popup with text area for preferences, Chrome storage, on/off toggle
3. 🔜 **Phase 3: LLM Integration** — Background script calling Claude/OpenAI API, batch scoring, caching
4. 🔜 **Phase 4: Visual Filtering** — Hide/dim low-scoring videos, handle infinite scroll
5. 🔜 **Phase 5: Polish** — Mood presets, filter strictness slider, performance optimization

## Current YouTube DOM Selectors (as of Feb 2025)
YouTube has migrated to new web components. Old selectors like `#video-title`, `ytd-channel-name` no longer work.

**Working selectors:**
- **Video containers:** `ytd-rich-item-renderer` (homepage items)
- **Title:** `h3 a` (inside each renderer)
- **Channel:** `yt-content-metadata-view-model a`
- **Duration:** `yt-thumbnail-bottom-overlay-view-model .yt-badge-shape__text`
- **Thumbnail:** `yt-thumbnail-view-model img`
- **Metadata (views/age):** `span.yt-content-metadata-view-model__metadata-text`
- **Shorts detection:** `[class*="shortsLockupViewModelHost"]` — skip these

**Sidebar videos** (`ytd-compact-video-renderer`) may use different selectors — not yet tested.

## Technical Preferences
- Manifest V3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no build step)
- Keep it simple, Andrew wants to understand every line

## Development Instructions
Always commit changes after completing and testing any instructed change.

## Session Continuity Rule
**CRITICAL: After completing any task or set of changes, ALWAYS update the Session Log at the bottom of this file before finishing.** This ensures the next Claude Code session has full context without the user needing to re-explain anything. Update the log with:
- What was done
- What's working / what's broken
- What the next steps are
- Any decisions or context that would be lost

# Session Log

## Session: 2025-02-01 — Fixed DOM Selectors & Git Setup
**What was done:**
- Connected to YouTube via Claude in Chrome MCP to inspect live DOM
- Discovered YouTube has fully migrated to `yt-lockup-view-model` / `yt-content-metadata-view-model` web components
- Old selectors (`#video-title`, `ytd-channel-name #text`, `img#img`, etc.) all return null
- Updated `content.js` with working selectors (see "Current YouTube DOM Selectors" above)
- Added Shorts filtering (skips items with `shortsLockupViewModelHost` class)
- Initialized git repo, pushed to GitHub (squattingpanda/youtube-algorithm-control)
- Created project-specific CLAUDE.md for session continuity

**What's working:**
- Phase 1 confirmed working ✅ — extension detects ~30+ videos, skips Shorts, extracts title/channel/duration/meta

**Next steps:**
- Phase 2 done ✅ — needs testing (reload extension, click icon, enter prefs)
- Phase 3: LLM Integration (background script, API calls, batch scoring, caching)

## Session: 2025-02-01 — Phase 2 Popup UI
**What was done:**
- Created popup.html with text area, toggle switch, save button (YouTube-red theme)
- Created popup.js for load/save via chrome.storage.local
- Updated content.js to read prefs from storage + listen for changes + respect toggle
- Updated manifest.json with action.default_popup

**What needs testing:**
- Reload extension → click icon → popup should appear
- Enter preferences, save, close, reopen → should persist
- Toggle off → console shows "Filtering disabled"
- Toggle on → normal video logging with preferences shown

**Next steps:**
- Confirm Phase 2 works, then Phase 3: LLM Integration
